# Medusa workflow as a test for custom module

Since the main service of a new module is registered in the Medusa DI container, you can do things with it like build a workflow. A workflow is like an in-house function in Medusa that performs business functions with rollback logic and other platform sugar.

So once you have created the model and service and associated "internal" stuff, you can then actually _use_ that feature possibly in a workflow.

Make a file named after your workflow in `src/workflows`.

Create a type for the workflow's input.

Use `@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk` to create a step and a workflow:

The `createStep` function takes the name of the workflow, a function to run as the step, and an optional third parameter which is a compensation function to run as rollback if there are errors during the workflow steps. The function parameters receive the workflow input type and an object containing the Medusa container as input.

The `createWorkflow` function takes the name of the workflow and a function that implements the steps and returns a `WorkflowResponse`. That function also receives the workflow input as a parameter, but not the container.

In short, you make a _step_ which receives the medusa container and allows you to using your module services in that logic. Then, you arrange steps in order with compensation logic between them using the workflow stuff.

_Module -> Service -> Step -> Workflow -> API route_

---

Next, we add an API route in `src/api/blog/posts/route.ts`.

It works like a file-based Next.js API route with `MedusaRequest` instead of `NextRequest` etc.
In your POST or GET function you call the implementation of `createWorkflow` from above, e.g. `createPostWorkflow(req.scope).run({input:{title: 'blah'}})`.

"In the API route, you execute the createPostWorkflow by invoking it, passing it the Medusa container in req.scope, then invoking the run method. In the run method, you pass the workflow's input in the input property."

You can also execute the workflow not just from an API route but also from a subscriber when an event occurs or on a scheduled job. Cool.
