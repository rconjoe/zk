# Steps to modify medusa backend

_https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/basics/modules_

0. Create module directory e.g. `modules/blog, modules/blog/models`

1. Create a data model.

For this you can use the `model` utility from `@medusajs/framework/utils`. It feels like a nice ORM-like thing as a go between for your custom models and having the tight medusa integration (e.g. using the same db)
Use it to `define("snake_case_name", { id: ...id().primaryKey() })` etc

2. Create a service.

This is what ends up going through Medusa's DI and is registered in the container at runtime.
Define a `service.ts` at the root of the module directory.
Import `MedusaService` and your model from step 1.
Default export a class extending `MedusaService({Model})`.

What the container gets out of this is a class with generated CRUD methods. `BlogModuleService`
will actually have `createPosts`, `retrievePost`, etc. All methods: https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/service-factory-reference

If a module doesn't have data models, e.g. integrating some third party function, it doesn't need to extend `MedusaService`.

3. Export module definition.

This is done via `index.ts` at module root.

You use the `Module` framework utility to pass the name of the module and an object containing its main service.

4. Add module to Medusa config

In `medusa-config.ts` you add a `modules` property with an array with the new module.
Each object in the `modules` array has a `resolve` property whose value is either a path to the module directory, or an npm package name.
This will register it for DI in the Medusa container.

5. Generate migrations

This I assume means running the `model.define()` code. Pretty cool how medusa makes it easy to integrate so tight,
and not have to build out separate stuff for everything you want to add.

To generate migrations for a module run
` npx medusa db:generate <model>`
where `model` should probably match what you pass for the DI container name thing in `index.ts`.

Note: this will fail if you skip step 4 :)

6. Run migrations

`npx medusa db:migrate`
